## About me
Hello, my name is **Max Reid** and I am an exchange student form _Trinity College Dublin_ [link here](https://www.tcd.ie/). At my home University I study Management Science and Information Systems Studies (MSISS for short). I am studying in Auckland for one semester and am excited to learn loads. 
The top 3 things I want to see in New Zealand are:
1. Hobbiton
2. Queenstown + surrounding mountains
3. Milford Sound

## About the repository
In this repository I will be working on the assignments for my favourite class (Stats 220: Data Technologies). 
Assignment 1 entails the creation of:
- A picture meme
- A gif meme

To find inspiration for my meme, I browsed [Giphy](https://giphy.com/) and [KnowYourMeme](https://knowyourmeme.com/).
